All wellness data, like steps and distance, contained in the activity are already represented in the Daily summary and in the corresponding Epoch summaries, so Activity Detail summaries should only be used for programs that wish to treat specific activity types in different ways, such as giving the user extra credit for going swimming three times in the same week.
