## Sentry monitoring

To enable Sentry monitoring:

1. Set a `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable that points to the desired Sentry DSN.
2. (Optional) Set the `SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to control the minimum log level of events sent to Sentry.
   The default log level for Sentry is `ERROR`. Possible values are `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`.
