  - doc: Each activity detail contains an activity summary and an optional list of samples. The samples list will be empty if the activity is manual or details are not supported by the device. Samples may be as frequent as once per second, and values should be considered valid until the next sample.
    topic: push_garmin_activity_detail_sample
    value_schema: .push.garmin.GarminActivityDetailsSample
  - doc: Body battery value recorded for the time. Usually assocaited with Stress Details Summary using summaryId. Information on and a list of devices that support Body Battery are available here- https://support.garmin.com/ms-MY/?faq=2qczgfbN00AIMJbX33dRq9.
    topic: push_garmin_body_battery_sample
    value_schema: .push.garmin.GarminBodyBatterySample
  - doc: Mapping between time (in seconds) to a heart rate value recorded for the time, in beats per minute. Each entry is a representative sample of the previous 15 seconds from the given time. Lack of entry for a given time should be interpreted as no data available. These are accompanied with the Daily summary data and can be associated using the summaryId.
    topic: push_garmin_heart_rate_sample
    value_schema: .push.garmin.GarminHeartRateSample
  - doc: Sleep level time ranges, currently deep, light, rem and awake. Time ranges are represented as unix timestamps in seconds. Usually associated with Sleep Summary data using the summaryId field.
    topic: push_garmin_sleep_level
    value_schema: .push.garmin.GarminSleepLevel
  - doc: Stress levels are provided as 3-minute averages of the real-time stress scores generated on the device with values ranging from 1 to 100. A value of -1 means there was not enough data to detect stress, and -2 means there was too much motion (e.g. the user was walking or running). Scores between 1 and 25 are considered “rest” (i.e. not stressful), 26-50 as “low” stress, 51-75 “medium” stress, and 76- 100 as “high” stress. Usually assocaited with Stress Details Summary using the summaryId.
    topic: push_garmin_stress_level
    value_schema: .push.garmin.GarminStressLevelSample
  - doc: Blood pressure summaries offer data from blood pressure readings taken using an Index BPM device or from a user’s manually uploaded blood pressure data. This includes systolic, diastolic, and pulse values taken at the time of the blood pressure reading. For more information about the validation of data using the Index BPM, please visit https://www.garmin.com/en-US/bpmvalidation/.
    topic: push_garmin_blood_pressure
    value_schema: .push.garmin.GarminBloodPressureSummary
  - doc: A map of sleep score string descriptions for each type of sleep as well as restless periods and stress levels during sleep. Each entry in the sleepScores will have a qualifierKey value of EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, or POOR that is used as a qualitative description of the user’s period of sleep.

  - doc: The Garmin Health Snapshot is a collection of key health-related insights recorded during a two-minute session on a compatible device. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), Pulse Ox, respiration, and stress are the metrics included this summary, which collectively provide you a glimpse of your overall cardiovascular status. More information about Health Snapshot can be found at https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=PB1duL5p6V64IQwhNvcRK9.
